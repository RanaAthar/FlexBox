# FlexBox
Here I understand the full concept  of flexbox  which will be help for me in future and other peoples.
Flexbox("Flexible box layout")  : it is one dimension layout method for arranging items in rows or columns
  Flex
   direction:it set how flex items are placed in flex container , along which axix and direction I(row .row reverse , column , column reverse).its default direction is row 
   In flex container if height and width of our item is big for example if hieght and width of our container is 800px and the height and width of our one flex item is 350 px and there are 6 flex items so but our flex contianer maintain that flex items in their border not outside border but remember if we are doing flex container height and width small and small and flex item is same so jb tak our content is allow to fit in border then
